# A pipeline to generate air temperature data at hourly resolution on US cities!

This project is an assembly line using [brassens](github.com/NIEHS/brassens/), [samba](github.com/NIEHS/samba) and [mercury](github.com/NIEHS/mercury) libraries to automatically generate 2-meters air temperature rasters on a list of US cities and observed months.  

The aim is to create a database of case studies on the first major US cities during some specific heat and cold events.
