# A factory to generate air temperature data at hourly resolution on US cities!

This project is an assembly line using [brassens](github.com/NIEHS/brassens/), [samba](github.com/NIEHS/samba) and [mercury](github.com/NIEHS/mercury) libraries to automatically generate 2-meters air temperature rasters on a list of US cities and observed months.  

This pipeline has generate casestudies on the top largest Urban Census areas on different climatic events (heatwave, blizzard, typical weather...) and seasons. This dataset has been designed for environmental epidemiology and public health studies on (extreme) temperature exposure in US cities. It can also be leveraged by urban climatologists to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal evolution of the urban heat island with regard to the variety of city layout and climatic region in the US.
